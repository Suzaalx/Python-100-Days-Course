Learned about dictionary and nesting.

The final project was to create a program where each person can enter their name and bid amount using dictonary and nesting through the dictionary to check the highest bid.

I was kind of stuck in nesting and the proper symbol between dictionary{} and list[]

Day 10 is also done.So Im only 1/10 through the whole journey.

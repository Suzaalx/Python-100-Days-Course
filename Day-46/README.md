Donw with day 46.

Had to deal with a lot of API documentaion ,but well the project was kind of easy .

Took me a while to understand tho.

Created a app which allows us to input a date and then we will scrape the top 100 billboard songs of that date and will create a Spotify playlist.

Super useful project for me.
